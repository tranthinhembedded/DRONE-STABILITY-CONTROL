# INTEGRATION OF PID, FUZZY LOGIC, AND MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS IN DRONE STABILITY CONTROL UNDER CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS

Abstract. The integration of PID, Fuzzy Logic, and Machine Learning algorithms into the stability control system of drones under varying environmental conditions is a crucial solution to enhance drone performance in real-world applications. The study proposes the use of PID to maintain the basic stability of the drone by quickly addressing minor deviations, including roll and pitch angles, yaw rotation, altitude, and spatial position deviations relative to the desired trajectory or equilibrium state, and by adjusting thrust dynamics to balance the drone in real time. Fuzzy Logic functions as an adaptive controller, handling nonlinear environmental signals such as wind disturbances or payload changes, enabling the drone to respond promptly and flexibly. Machine Learning is responsible for learning and optimizing system parameters based on sensor data from past flights, improving prediction and decision-making capabilities under dynamic environmental conditions. The system is implemented on a hardware platform comprising a Raspberry Pi as the central processing unit and an MPU6050 as the inertial measurement unit (IMU), which collects real-time data on the drone's orientation and acceleration. The study also evaluates environmental factors such as wind, temperature fluctuations, and payload changes affecting the drone's stability. Simulation and experimental results with this hardware configuration have demonstrated the system's effectiveness, and the research team hopes that this application will contribute to the advancement of drone control technologies.
